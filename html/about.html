  <h1>About Reframe</h1>

  <section>
    <div class="copy">Reframe is a platform that facilitates relationships between like-minded women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by providing young women the opportunity to review and apply for potential mentors.
    <br><br>
    Users from local middle and high schools in Los Angeles can review and apply for mentors (current UCLA students), who will pair with mentees based on their profile and interests. Mentees can have multiple mentors in order to explore different STEM fields.
    <br><br>
    Reframe's focus on building mentorships between women aims to spark interest and increase retention in STEM. This is a community for women to not only have one shared voice in the greater conversation for equality and diversity in STEM but to also support and inspire one another.
    <br><br>
    Created by a mentor and mentee, Reframe is a product of its very mission, proving that with the right guidance, encouragement and learning environment, a woman can feel empowered to own her place and worth in the STEM community.
